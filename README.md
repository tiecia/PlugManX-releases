# What is this?

This is a repo containing releases of the PlugManX fork of the PlugMan spigot plugin.

PlugManX: https://github.com/TheBlackEntity/PlugMan/

# Why does this repo exist?

I need a known-good location for my other projects to retrieve the plugin from, and the PlugManX repo does not have official releases.


If the owner of PlugManX would like this taken down please contact me.
